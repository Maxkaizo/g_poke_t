INTRODUCTION

What is Pokémon?

Pokémon is a role-playing game (RPG) franchise created by Satoshi Tajiri 
in 1996. Although on the surface it seems like a simple "catch and collect" 
game, it actually contains an incredibly deep combat system based on 
statistics, types, abilities, and strategy.

The main goal is to become a Pokémon Master by capturing, training, and 
evolving these creatures while exploring different regions and defeating 
other trainers in turn-based strategic battles.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

HISTORICAL CONTEXT

• 1996: Launch of Pokémon Red and Green in Japan for Game Boy
• Generations: Currently there are 9 generations with over 1000 species
• Mechanics: The combat system has evolved but maintains its original 
  foundations
• Creator: Satoshi Tajiri was inspired by his childhood passion for 
  collecting insects

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SYSTEM DEPTH

• 18 types with complex effectiveness interactions
• 6 statistics that determine battle performance
• Hidden values (IVs and EVs) that add individual variation
• Over 900 different moves with unique effects
• Ability system that modifies combat
• Weather, terrain, and other environmental condition mechanics

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TYPE SYSTEM

The type system is the core of Pokémon combat. Each Pokémon has one or 
two types, and each move has one type. The effectiveness of an attack 
depends on the interaction between the move's type and the target 
Pokémon's types.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DAMAGE MULTIPLIERS

✅ SUPER EFFECTIVE (2x): The attack is very strong against that type
   Damage is doubled. If a type has a double weakness (two types 
   vulnerable to the same attack), the multiplier is 4x.

⚪ NEUTRAL (1x): Normal damage
   No type advantage or disadvantage.

❌ NOT VERY EFFECTIVE (0.5x): The attack is weak against that type
   Damage is reduced to half. If both types resist, the multiplier 
   is 0.25x.

🚫 IMMUNE (0x): The attack has no effect
   The move causes no damage. For example, Normal-type moves don't 
   affect Ghost types.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

THE 18 TYPES AND THEIR INTERACTIONS

🔥 FIRE TYPE
   Strong against: Grass, Ice, Bug, Steel
   Weak against: Water, Ground, Rock
   Iconic Pokémon: Charizard, Arcanine, Blaziken

💧 WATER TYPE
   Strong against: Fire, Ground, Rock
   Weak against: Grass, Electric
   Iconic Pokémon: Blastoise, Gyarados, Greninja

🌱 GRASS TYPE
   Strong against: Water, Ground, Rock
   Weak against: Fire, Ice, Poison, Flying, Bug
   Iconic Pokémon: Venusaur, Sceptile, Decidueye

⚡ ELECTRIC TYPE
   Strong against: Water, Flying
   Weak against: Ground
   Immune to: None (but Ground is immune to Electric)
   Iconic Pokémon: Pikachu, Raichu, Luxray

🔮 PSYCHIC TYPE
   Strong against: Fighting, Poison
   Weak against: Bug, Ghost, Dark
   Iconic Pokémon: Alakazam, Mewtwo, Espeon

🐉 DRAGON TYPE
   Strong against: Dragon
   Weak against: Ice, Dragon, Fairy
   Iconic Pokémon: Dragonite, Salamence, Garchomp

🧚 FAIRY TYPE (Introduced in Generation VI)
   Strong against: Fighting, Dragon, Dark
   Weak against: Poison, Steel
   Immune to: Dragon
   Iconic Pokémon: Sylveon, Gardevoir, Togekiss

⚫ DARK TYPE
   Strong against: Psychic, Ghost
   Weak against: Fighting, Bug, Fairy
   Immune to: Psychic
   Iconic Pokémon: Umbreon, Tyranitar, Hydreigon

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

STAB (SAME-TYPE ATTACK BONUS)

When a Pokémon uses a move that matches its own type, the damage is 
multiplied by 1.5x.

Example: When Pikachu (Electric type) uses Thunderbolt (Electric move), 
the attack is 50% stronger than if a Pokémon of another type used it.

Strategy: This incentivizes using moves of the same type as your Pokémon, 
but it's also important to have coverage moves to attack the opponent's 
weaknesses.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STATISTICS SYSTEM

Each Pokémon has six main statistics that determine its battle performance. 
These statistics are influenced by several factors: the Pokémon's species 
(base stats), its level, its IVs (individual values), its EVs (effort 
values), and its nature.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

THE SIX STATISTICS

❤️ HP (HIT POINTS)
   Health points. Determines how much damage it can receive before 
   fainting. When it reaches 0, the Pokémon faints and cannot continue 
   battling.

⚔️ ATTACK
   Determines the damage of physical moves like Tackle, Fire Punch, 
   Earthquake, or Dragon Claw. The higher it is, the more damage your 
   physical attacks will do.

🛡️ DEFENSE
   Reduces damage received from physical attacks. A Pokémon with high 
   Defense can withstand powerful physical blows.

✨ SPECIAL ATTACK
   Determines the damage of special moves like Flamethrower, Hydro Pump, 
   Psychic, or Thunderbolt. Special moves are usually elemental or 
   energy attacks.

🌟 SPECIAL DEFENSE
   Reduces damage received from special attacks. Protects against moves 
   like Surf, Psybeam, or Flare Blitz.

⚡ SPEED
   Determines which Pokémon attacks first each turn. The faster Pokémon 
   generally attacks first (except with priority moves). Crucial for 
   offensive strategies.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

IVs (INDIVIDUAL VALUES)

They are random genetic values between 0 and 31 for each statistic. 
Two Pokémon of the same species can have different stats due to their 
unique IVs.

• Range: 0-31 for each stat (6 stats in total)
• Assignment: Random when encountering or breeding a Pokémon
• Impact: An IV of 31 vs 0 can mean ~15-20 points difference in a 
  stat at level 100

Example: A Pikachu with 31 IVs in Speed will be faster than one with 
0 IVs, even at the same level.

Competitive: Serious players seek Pokémon with perfect IVs (31 in all 
relevant stats, called "6IV" or "5IV" if one stat doesn't matter).

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

EVs (EFFORT VALUES)

They are points you gain by defeating Pokémon. You can distribute up to 
510 EVs in total, with a maximum of 252 per statistic. Every 4 EVs equal 
+1 point in that stat at level 100.

• Total maximum: 510 EVs
• Maximum per stat: 252 EVs
• Conversion: 4 EVs = +1 stat point at level 100
• Acquisition: Defeat specific Pokémon, use vitamins, or items

Common distributions:
• 252/252/4: Maximize two stats, put the remaining 4 in another
• 252/128/128: Main focus with two secondaries
• 252/252/0/0/0/4: Extreme specialization

Strategy: Competitive players train specifically against Pokémon that 
give EVs in the stats they want to maximize. For example, defeating 
Starly gives +1 EV in Speed.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

NATURES

Each Pokémon has a nature that increases one statistic by 10% and reduces 
another by 10%. There are 25 different natures, and choosing the right 
one is crucial for competitive strategy.

Popular natures:

• JOLLY: +Speed / -Special Attack
  Ideal for fast physical attackers

• MODEST: +Special Attack / -Attack
  Perfect for special attackers

• ADAMANT: +Attack / -Special Attack
  Excellent for pure physical attackers

• TIMID: +Speed / -Attack
  Great for fast special attackers

• CAREFUL: +Special Defense / -Special Attack
  Good for special tanks

Neutral natures (don't modify anything):
• Hardy, Docile, Quirky, Bashful, Serious

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

BATTLE MECHANICS

Pokémon battles are turn-based combats where strategy is key. Each turn, 
you choose an action: use a move, switch Pokémon, use an item, or run 
(in wild battles). The order of actions is mainly determined by Speed.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DAMAGE CALCULATION

Damage is calculated using a complex formula that considers:

1. Attacker's level
2. Move's base power
3. Attacker's Attack vs target's Defense
4. Type effectiveness (0x, 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 4x)
5. STAB (1.5x if the type matches)
6. Critical hit (1.5x extra damage)
7. Random variation (85%-100%)
8. Additional modifiers (weather, abilities, items)

Simplified formula:
Damage = ((2 × Level / 5 + 2) × Power × Atk/Def / 50 + 2) × Modifiers

Modifiers include STAB, type effectiveness, critical, weather, and the 
random factor.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

ACCURACY AND CRITICAL HITS

ACCURACY:
Each move has an accuracy percentage. More powerful moves usually have 
lower accuracy to balance the game.

Examples:
• Hydro Pump: 80% accuracy, 110 power
• Surf: 100% accuracy, 90 power
• Thunder: 70% accuracy, 110 power
• Thunderbolt: 100% accuracy, 90 power

CRITICAL HITS:
• Base probability: ~4.17% (1/24)
• Effect: 1.5x damage
• Ignore negative stat changes on the attacker and positive ones on 
  the defender
• Some moves and abilities increase critical hit rate

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

STATUS CONDITIONS

🔥 BURN
   • Damage: Loses 1/16 of max HP each turn
   • Effect: Physical Attack reduced to half
   • Duration: Permanent until cured
   • Strategy: Excellent against physical attackers

⚡ PARALYSIS

POKÉMON EVOLUTION

Evolution is the process by which a Pokémon transforms into a more 
powerful form. When a Pokémon evolves, its base statistics increase 
significantly, it can learn new moves, and sometimes changes type or 
gains a second type.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

EVOLUTION METHODS

📈 BY LEVEL
The most common method. The Pokémon evolves upon reaching a specific level.

Examples:
• Charmander → Charmeleon (level 16) → Charizard (level 36)
• Pidgey → Pidgeotto (level 18) → Pidgeot (level 36)
• Magikarp → Gyarados (level 20)

💎 BY STONE
Use a specific evolution stone (Fire Stone, Water Stone, Thunder Stone, etc.).

Examples:
• Pikachu + Thunder Stone → Raichu
• Eevee + Water Stone → Vaporeon
• Vulpix + Fire Stone → Ninetales
• Clefairy + Moon Stone → Clefable

💝 BY FRIENDSHIP
Level up with high happiness/friendship (220+ on a scale of 0-255).

Examples:
• Eevee → Espeon (daytime, with high friendship)
• Eevee → Umbreon (nighttime, with high friendship)
• Golbat → Crobat (high friendship)
• Chansey → Blissey (high friendship)

How to increase friendship:
• Walk with the Pokémon
• Level up
• Use vitamins
• Give massages
• Don't let it faint

🔄 BY TRADING
Trade the Pokémon with another player.

Examples:
• Kadabra → Alakazam (when traded)
• Machoke → Machamp (when traded)
• Graveler → Golem (when traded)
• Haunter → Gengar (when traded)

Some require item:
• Onix + Metal Coat → Steelix (when traded)
• Seadra + Dragon Scale → Kingdra (when traded)

📍 BY LOCATION
Level up in a specific location (magnetic field, mossy rock, icy rock, etc.).

Examples:
• Eevee → Leafeon (near Moss Rock)
• Eevee → Glaceon (near Ice Rock)
• Magneton → Magnezone (in area with magnetic field)
• Nosepass → Probopass (in area with magnetic field)

🎯 SPECIAL CONDITIONS
Unique methods: knowing a move, specific gender, time of day, having 
another Pokémon in the party, etc.

Examples:
• Piloswine → Mamoswine (level up knowing "Ancient Power")
• Eevee → Sylveon (level up knowing Fairy-type move + high friendship)
• Tyrogue → Hitmonchan (level 20, Attack < Defense)
• Tyrogue → Hitmonlee (level 20, Attack > Defense)
• Tyrogue → Hitmontop (level 20, Attack = Defense)
• Mantyke → Mantine (level up with Remoraid in party)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

IMPORTANT FACTS ABOUT EVOLUTION

✅ STAT INCREASE
Base statistics increase significantly, making the Pokémon much stronger. 
For example, Charmander has 309 total base stats, while Charizard has 534.

⏸️ CANCEL EVOLUTION
You can press B during the animation to cancel it. Useful if you want 
it to learn moves earlier that are only available in its pre-evolved form.

🎓 EXCLUSIVE MOVES
Some Pokémon learn certain moves only before evolving. For example, 
Charmander learns "Flamethrower" at level 34, but Charmeleon learns it 
at level 42. Plan well!

🔒 IRREVERSIBLE EVOLUTION
Once a Pokémon evolves, it cannot return to its previous form (except 
with special mechanics like Mega Evolution or Dynamax, which are temporary).

🎭 TYPE CHANGE
Some Pokémon change type when they evolve. For example:
• Eevee (Normal) → Vaporeon (Water)
• Swablu (Normal/Flying) → Altaria (Dragon/Flying)
• Azurill (Normal/Fairy) → Marill (Water/Fairy)

TIPS FOR PLAYERS

1. BUILD A BALANCED TEAM
   Don't use 6 Pokémon of the same type. Diversify to cover more 
   weaknesses and have advantages against different opponents.

2. KNOW THE WEAKNESSES
   Memorize the most important type interactions. Knowing what's 
   effective against what will give you an advantage in battle.

3. TRAIN YOUR EVs STRATEGICALLY
   Don't let your Pokémon gain random EVs. Plan which stats you want 
   to maximize and train against specific Pokémon.

4. USE COVERAGE MOVES
   Don't only use moves of your Pokémon's type. Include moves that 
   cover its weaknesses.

5. CONSIDER SPEED
   In competitive battles, attacking first can be the difference 
   between winning and losing. Invest in Speed when necessary.
